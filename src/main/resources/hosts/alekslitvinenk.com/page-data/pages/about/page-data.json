This early experience predestined my future profession choice: ever since then I had keen interest in programming and was determined to become a programmer. </p>\n<p>Between 2006 and 2009 before I got my first job as a programmer. I was making living from being a freelance Dlash Developer. Flash was a leading edge technology back then and demand in flash programmers was really huge. I even secured two remote full-time contracts with the US company and the Danish one. </p>\n<p>In 2009 I landed my first office job. It was a start-up company which was developing games for social networks and mobiles. I learned to work in the office environment and to be a part of the five-some members team of frontend guys. </p>\n<p>In 2011 I landed on my second office job in a start-up company which was developing a system for creating interactive presentations, 3D panoramas and hypermedia sites. I was a full stack developer there. Though my primary responsibility was frontend development I also got my hands dirty with C++, PHP, Java and other technologies. My biggest achievement there was I ported openssl library to flash using alchemy technology which allows you to compile C and C++ code into LLVM and then to flash. I got our client side encryption module to work 10 times faster. </p>\n<p>In 2012 I moved to my next job. It was an invest holding company. I was the team leader in my project. I had 4 people in our team directly reporting to me. We were developing a promo game which was supposed to increase sales of our company’s financial services. I wrote code in AS3, JavaScript, Objective-C, C# and Python (we were using it for the backhand). Here I became acquainted with many technologies and services such as Google’s App engine, Blockchain, Test Flight, guaranteed message delivery systems  in general and DotNetMQ in particular. I got accustomed to scrum ceremonies such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives at the end of the sprint.</p>\n<p>In 2013 I started my new job as a Lead Frontend Engineer in a start-up game development studio. I was writing code in AS3, Java and Bash. I had one other developer directly reporting to me. Here I got acquainted with Amazon Web Services, GitHub. I got my hands dirty with ProtoBuf and even fixed couple of bugs in 3rd party Flash plug-in. Namely, it didn’t support unnamed fields which were required by specification and which we were dependent on. It was a very interesting time I got used to work on Saturdays and constant crunches.</p>\n<p>In the year 2014 I moved to a new job. The guys were developing casino games and were providing B2B services for casino license holders. I was a Full-stack developer. I developed many slot machine games and a live roulette game and a few live poker game. I was developing games in AS3 for the frontend part. For the backend we were using Elixir. Thus I began my acquaintance with functional programming. At this time flash already seemed increasingly outdated technology. So I propose to migration to HaXe. I wrote the framework in this language for our needs and successfully trained the team to use it. As the outcome of this we were able to have single codebase and assemble billds for web, mobile and arcade machines. </p>\n<p>And finally I moved to my present job.it was the first time when I was invited to work abroad. Relocation was a very interesting experience, I got a lot of new friends, significantly improved my English and did a pivot to become a Java/Scala Engineer. I began my acquaintance with the Docker, Kubernetes, message brokers in Java (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Kafka).</p>\n<p>I have a wide range of interest starting from national cuisines across the world, photography, travelling and sport activities like running and swimming. I like to contribute to open software foundation. I am an active member of GitHub community. Recently I began my own project which is called docker-openvpn, which is a nutshell a dockerized OpenVPN server which allows you to get secure Internet connection in less than two seconds. </p>\n<p>I sincerely believe I’m going to be a great asset in your company and greatly contribute to your business.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
